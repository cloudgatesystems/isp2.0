# Contributing to ISP 2.0

ISP 2.0 was created to provide a centralized set of guidelines that current and future ISPs can use to better their service and protect data on the Internet. As such, these guidelines can be created/modified by anyone. We've created this guide to create an effecient and maintainable workflow, so that anyone can contribute with little difficulty.

## Sharing Your Voice

Want to share your voice? Have a suggestion for an existing guideline? Great! The best way to get your voice out there is to create an Issue. Make sure to use the template so we all know what your talking about.

Oh, and it should go without saying, but please be kind to everyone. While we may not agree on everything, our goal is to make the Internet better.

## Creating New Guidelines

Have an idea that isn't in the current guidelines? Awesome! We suggest that you fork the repository, create the page(s) expressing your guidlines, and creating a pull request to branch `rolling-iteration`.

## Modifying Existing Guidelines

Terminology is important. While we do want to keep these guidelines fairly open-ended, the goal and idea of each guideline needs to still be clear. We suggest using the Issue tracker to discuss changes, but you are more than welcome to for the repository, make the changes, and create a pull request to branch `rolling-iteration`.
