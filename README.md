# ISP 2.0 - The Guidelines for a Free and Fair ISP

> CloudGate Systems' mission statemet is *"if the practices are missing or malformed, create better practices."* We are taking this mission statement very seriously with ISP 2.0. These guidelines are created by the Internet to define what a free and fair ISP is, how it should be regulated both internally and externally, and rules on how data should be treated while traveling through the Internet.

## Table of Contents
*There doesn't seem to be anything here, yet...*

## Branches and Versioning
For the latest updates to the guidelines, check out the `rolling-iteration` branch. The `master` branch should be considered the guidelines to follow, as all language and grammatical issues have been ironed out.

While ISP 2.0 is a living set of guidelines, meaning they are ever changing, there may be times when it is appropriate to create a "version" of the repository. A version is a snapshot of the repository where the guidelines are presumed to be complete. When a version is captured, it's terminology and language can not be modified unless major issues arise. Each version builds upon the last.

ISP 2.0 is created by the Internet for the Internet (service providers), so feel free to help us! During the early stages, organization of the guidelines is going to be pretty messy, but don't let that stop you, we need all the help we can get. Remember: these guidelines are being created to create a better ISP, and hopefully a better Internet.
