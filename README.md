# ISP 2.0 - The Guidelines for a Free and Fair ISP

> CloudGate Systems' mission statemet is *"if the practices are missing or malformed, create better practices."* We are taking this mission statement very seriously with ISP 2.0. These guidelines are created by the Internet to define what a free and fair ISP is, how it should be regulated both internally and externally, and rules on how data should be treated while traveling through the Internet.

ISP 2.0 is created by the Internet for the Internet (service providers), so feel free to help us! During the early stages, organization of the guidelines is going to be pretty messy, but don't let that stop you, we need all the help we can get. Remember: these guidelines are being created to create a better ISP, and hopefully a better Internet.
